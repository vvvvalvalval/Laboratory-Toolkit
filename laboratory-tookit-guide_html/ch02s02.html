	The best way to understand how the <span class="application">Laboratory Toolkit</span> works is to see a few examples.
      </p><p>
	In this section, we will to study an example of using the <span class="application">Laboratory Toolkit</span> to perform simple analyses on a String-represented text.
      </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp137456"></a>Step 1 : defining the equipment.</h3></div></div></div><p>
	  First, we need to encapsulate the data we are working on in an <span class="emphasis"><em>equipment</em></span> object for our future <code class="classname">Analysis</code>S to work on. This is done by declaring an <span class="emphasis"><em>equipment</em></span> for our future analyses :
	  </p><pre class="programlisting">
/**
 * The equipment out future {@link Analysis}S shall use : for the moment, it
 * only gives access to the initial text.
 */
public interface TextLabEquipment {

    //here we give access to our initial data.
    public String text();
}
	  </pre><p>
	  We will probably add some other methods later. But that won't be any problem for our development.
	</p><p>
	  Although the equipment can be really <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> Java type, it's always better to define it with an interface. But while we're at it, we'll declare an implementation class too. Instances of this class will be used to instantiate the <code class="classname">Laboratory</code>(s) in which we will perform our analyses.
	  </p><pre class="programlisting">
/**
 * Simple {@link TextLabEquipment} implementation.
 */
public class SimpleTextLabEquipment implements TextLabEquipment {

    private final String text;

    public SimpleTextLabEquipment(String text) {
        this.text = text;
    }

    @Override
    public String text() {
        return this.text;
    }
}
	  </pre><p>
	</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp143120"></a>Step 2 : defining the Analyses.</h3></div></div></div><p>
	  Now we've got the ingredients, it's time to start cooking.
	</p><p>  First, it would be good to extract the words that are in our text. To do this, we will create an <code class="classname">Analysis</code> that splits our text into a list of words. Therefore, the <span class="emphasis"><em>result type</em></span> of our <code class="classname">Analysis</code> shall be a <code class="classname">List&lt;String&gt;</code> and the <span class="emphasis"><em>equipment type</em></span> of our <code class="classname">Analysis</code> shall simply be the <code class="classname">TextLabEquipment</code> interface we defined earlier:
	  </p><pre class="programlisting">
/**
 * Analysis that extracts the words from the raw text.
 */
public class WordsExtracting extends Analysis&lt;List&lt;String&gt;, TextLabEquipment&gt; {

    //this method defines of the extracting of the words is performed.
    @Override
    protected List&lt;String&gt; computeResult(ResultComputingContext&lt;TextLabEquipment&gt; context) {
        /*
         * The ResultComputingContext gives us access to the equipment, from which we access the text.
         */
        TextLabEquipment equipment = context.equipment();
        String rawText = equipment.text();
        //now we compute the result, by splitting the text into words.
        String[] split = rawText.split("\\W");
        List&lt;String&gt; result = Collections.unmodifiableList(Arrays.asList(split));
        
        return result;
    }

    /*
     * Our class is implemented using the Singleton pattern, which is common for Analyses.
     */
    private WordsExtracting() {
    }

    public static WordsExtracting getInstance() {
        return WordsExtractingHolder.INSTANCE;
    }

    private static class WordsExtractingHolder {

        private static final WordsExtracting INSTANCE = new WordsExtracting();
    }
}
	  </pre><p>
	  Some might start complaining that this is an awful lot of code for just filling one method. But actually, writing such a class really takes no time. Any modern IDE can generate a Singleton class extending a certain abstract class, i.e everything you can see here except what's actually inside the body of the <code class="methodname">computeResult()</code> method.
	</p><p>
	  Sweet. So now, we have the words, but we won't stop there, we're going to start doing something with them. First, let's say we're not interested in the words that have less than 4 letters. Don't ask me why, we may have our reasons, maybe we care only for four-or-more-letter-words. 
	</p><p>
	  So we could rewrite something like the previous code in <code class="classname">WordsExtracting</code>, and then add a step where we filtrate the wirds with less than four letters. But it'd be a shame not to reuse the code we've just written, right? So instead of that, we'll write another <code class="classname">Analysis</code>, which reexploits the result of <code class="classname">WordsExtracting</code>. Here's how it's done:
	  </p><pre class="programlisting">
/**
 * {@link Analysis} that extracts all the words of the text but those with less than 4 letters.
 */
public class FourOrMoreLettersWordsExtracting extends Analysis&lt;List&lt;String&gt;, TextLabEquipment&gt;{

    @Override
    protected List&lt;String&gt; computeResult(ResultComputingContext&lt;TextLabEquipment&gt; context) {
        
        //we explicitely request the result of WordsExtracting as a preliminary result.
        List&lt;String&gt; allWords = context.preliminaryResult(WordsExtracting.getInstance());
        
        //we filtrate the words
        List&lt;String&gt; fourOrMoreLettersWords = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
        for(String word : allWords){
            if(word.length()&gt;=4){
                fourOrMoreLettersWords.add(word);
            }
        }
        //we make it immutable, it's safer
        fourOrMoreLettersWords = Collections.unmodifiableList(fourOrMoreLettersWords);
        
        return fourOrMoreLettersWords;
    }
    
    //[...] Singleton Pattern stuff
}	    
	  </pre><p>
	</p><p>
	  Because that may come in handy someday, we'll extract still a bit more information from the words. We'd like something that gives us the <span class="emphasis"><em>set</em></span> of all words in the text; and while we're at it, being given any word, we'd like to know how many times it appears in the text.
	</p><p>
	  This time, the form of the result is more complicated than just a list. So we'll declare a custom result type (which is a good habit) :
	  </p><pre class="programlisting">
/**
 * Custom result type that gives us information about the distribution of words
 * in the text.
 */
public interface WordsFrequencies {

    /**
     * Gives us all the words without repetition.
     *
     * @return the set of all words in the text.
     */
    public Set&lt;String&gt; setOfWords();

    /**
     * @param anyWord a word, even one that's not in the text.
     * @return the number of occurences of that word in the text.
     */
    public int numberOfOccurencesInText(String anyWord);

    /**
     * Gives us the total number of word occurences in the text, e.g so we can
     * calculate frequencies.
     *
     * @return the total number of word occurences.
     */
    public int totalNumberOfWordsOccurences();
}
	  </pre><p>
	  And now, let's write the <code class="classname">Analysis for that :</code>
	  </p><pre class="programlisting">
/**
 * {@link Analysis} that extracts words frequencies information from text.
 */
public class WordsFrequenciesCalculating extends Analysis&lt;WordsFrequencies, TextLabEquipment&gt; {

    @Override
    protected WordsFrequencies computeResult(ResultComputingContext&lt;TextLabEquipment&gt; context) {
        
        //first, let's retrieve the words.
        List&lt;String&gt; words = context.preliminaryResult(FourOrMoreLettersWordsExtracting.getInstance());

        //this map will hold both the set of words and their frequencies.
        final Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; frequencies = new LinkedHashMap&lt;&gt;();
        //this integer counts the occurences of all words.
        int wordsCount = 0;
        for (String word : words) {
            //we increment the number of occurences of all words
            wordsCount++;
            //we increment the number of occurences of the current word.
            if (frequencies.containsKey(word)) {
                frequencies.put(word, frequencies.get(word) + 1);
            } else {
                frequencies.put(word, 1);
            }
        }

        final Set&lt;String&gt; setOfWords = Collections.unmodifiableSet(frequencies.keySet());
        final int totalNumberOfOccurences = wordsCount;

        //we return a result backed by the map of frequencies and the count of words :
        return new WordsFrequencies() {
            @Override
            public Set&lt;String&gt; setOfWords() {
                return setOfWords;
            }

            @Override
            public int numberOfOccurencesInText(String anyWord) {
                if (setOfWords().contains(anyWord)) {
                    return 0;
                } else {
                    return frequencies.get(anyWord);
                }
            }

            @Override
            public int totalNumberOfWordsOccurences() {
                return totalNumberOfOccurences;
            }
        };
    }

    //[...] Singleton pattern stuff.

	</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp164288"></a>Step 3 :Obtaining the results</h3></div></div></div><p>
	  So far, we've seen how we compute the results, but you may start to wonder how the results are retrieved from external code in your application. Actually, that should make you happy : separating the concerns of retrieving the results and declaring how they are computed is one of the main strengths of the Laboratory Framework.
	</p><p>
	  Once we have our initial data (in this example, the text), all we have to is wrapping it in an equipment object, creating a <code class="classname">Laboratory</code> with that equipment, and ask our <code class="classname">Analyses</code> to give us their result in the context of that <code class="classname">Laboratory</code>:
	  </p><pre class="programlisting">
        //that's our initial data
        String myText = "Lorem ipsum blah blah blah...";
        
        // [...]
        
        //instantiating the equipment that the Analyses will use
        TextLabEquipment myTextEquipment = new SimpleTextLabEquipment(myText);
        
	//creating a Laboratory with that equipment
        Laboratory&lt;TextLabEquipment&gt; myLab = new Laboratory&lt;&gt;(myTextEquipment);

        //requesting all the results we want.
        List&lt;String&gt; flwords = FourOrMoreLettersWordsExtracting.getInstance().getResult(myLab);
        WordsFrequencies wordsFreqs = WordsFrequenciesCalculating.getInstance().getResult(myLab);
        //computing is not redundant. We can ask the same result lots of times, it will always be the same.
        WordsExtracting.getInstance().getResult(myLab);
        WordsExtracting.getInstance().getResult(myLab);
        WordsExtracting.getInstance().getResult(myLab);	    
	  </pre><p>
	</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp170448"></a>Bonus : Varying the equipment</h3></div></div></div><p>
	  Now we have the words, let's on move to something else : the letters. Maybe because we're trying to implement an algorithm that learns how to play Scrabble, or something like that, we're going to extract the number of occurrences of each letter in our text.
	</p><p>
	  Great, that shouldn't be too complicated. We'll take the words of our text, split them into letters, and count the letters. So, you start writing the <code class="classname">Analysis</code> that does that, and then you're having an existential question : for counting the letters, should you be using <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> the words, or only those with 4 our more letters?
	</p><p>
	  You discuss this with your colleague, weight the pros and cons, and nobody can make a call for it, because for what you want to do both approches might be better than the other. You have to try both; worse, you don't want to experiment it by implementing one approach, then run it, then changing something in your code, then running it again. Instead, you want to make this a <span class="emphasis"><em>parameter</em></span> of your algorithm, to be set externally from the client code before running the result, in production.
	</p><p>
	  An good and simple way of achieving this is making this choice a property of your equipment object. First, we'll add a method to the equipment interface :
	  </p><pre class="programlisting">
public interface TextLabEquipment {

    //here we give access to our initial data.
    public String text();

    //we just added this method, to be used by the Analysis that counts the letters.
    public Analysis&lt;List&lt;String&gt;, TextLabEquipment&gt; relevantWordsForCountingLettersExtracting();
}
	  </pre><p>
	  Note that this is a quite harmless change. It doesn't cascade to all the <code class="classname">Analyses</code> you've already written. It merely makes you adapt your equipement implementation class, which you could have declared later anyway.
	</p><p>
	  In the <code class="classname">SimpleTextLabEquimpent</code> class, we will define a Java enum called <code class="classname">LettersCountingStrategy</code>, and add a property of that enum type to our class, to be set from the construtor. That way, when client code instantiates an equipment object, it will have to specify a strategy for counting the letters. The <code class="classname">SimpleTextLabEquipment</code> class now looks like this :
	  </p><pre class="programlisting">
public class SimpleTextLabEquipment implements TextLabEquipment {
    
    public static enum LettersCountingStrategy{
        ALL_WORDS,
        FOUR_OR_MORE_LETTERS_WORDS;
    }
    
    //that enum constant decides from which words extraction the letters are counted.
    private final LettersCountingStrategy lettersCountingStrategy;

    //when we instantiate our equipment object, we have to specify a strategy.
    public SimpleTextLabEquipment(String text, LettersCountingStrategy lettersCountingStrategy) {
        this.text = text;
        this.lettersCountingStrategy = lettersCountingStrategy;
    }
    
    @Override
    public Analysis&lt;List&lt;String&gt;, TextLabEquipment&gt; relevantWordsForCountingLettersExtracting() {
        switch(this.lettersCountingStrategy){
            case ALL_WORDS:
                return WordsExtracting.getInstance();
            case FOUR_OR_MORE_LETTERS_WORDS:
                return FourOrMoreLettersWordsExtracting.getInstance();
            default:
                throw new AssertionError();//won't happen.
        }
    }

    /*
     * The following part was already there at the beginning.
     */
    
    private final String text;

    @Override
    public String text() {
        return this.text;
    }
}	    
	  </pre><p>
	</p><p>
	  Now, let's write the <code class="classname">Analysis</code> that does the counting of letters. Like before for words, we create a custom interface for our result type :
	  </p><pre class="programlisting">
	    /**

public interface LettersFrequencies {

    public Set&lt;Character&gt; setOfLetters();

    public int totalNumberOfLettersOccurences();

	  Now, imagine the goal of your algorithm is to attach some score to every word in your text. Your mathematician colleague comes to you and gives you some horrible formula for scoring your words, something like: "So, you take the logarithm of the frequency of the first letter in your word, you add 1, and then you mutiply with the number of occurences of the word in the text."
	</p><p>
	  Alright, it's hideous, but good news it, you have a kit of <code class="classname">Analyses</code> that will let you implement that very quick. So you declare your result type, write your <code class="classname">Analysis</code>, then go home with light thoughts and watch a movie.
	</p><p>
	  Unfortunately, your mathematician colleague is the kind that changes his mind every other day. Next morning, when you go to work, he comes at you and says :
	  <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Um, remember that formula I gave you for the scores of words? Actually, it's not exactly that. It's that, <span class="emphasis"><em>plus 1, squared.</em></span>. Thanks!</span>&#8221;</span>
	</p><p>
	  Aarrrgh! Okay, so you can take a deep breath, go back to your <code class="classname">Analysis</code> class and change your code. It's a slight change, it's not gonna be <span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> bad.
	</p><p>
	  But you already know that, next week, it won't be "that, <span class="emphasis"><em>plus 1, squared</em></span>" anymore. Or maybe it won't be "<span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span>, plus 1, squared" anymore. And you're going to have to write 26 other <code class="classname">Analyses</code> that do almost the same thing until your colleague is satisfied.
	</p><p>
	  Luckily, there's a way for you to do much less work, simply by making your design more modular. Instead of implementing <span class="emphasis"><em>analyses</em></span>, you'll implement <span class="emphasis"><em>protocols</em></span> for your analyses. First, let's do things in the right order, and declare as usual a result type for our analyses:
	  </p><pre class="programlisting">
/**
 * Custom result type for scoring words.
 */
public interface WordsScore {

    public double score(String word);
}
	  </pre><p>
	  Now, you declare a class that implements the <code class="classname">Protocol</code> interface. A <code class="classname">Protocol</code> object is meant to tell an <code class="classname">Analysis</code> what it's supposed to do with its <code class="classname">ResultComputingContext</code>:
	  </p><pre class="programlisting">
/**
 * Protocol that computes the initial formula for scoring words.
 */
public class FrequenciesWordsScoringProtocol implements Protocol&lt;WordsScore, TextLabEquipment&gt;{

    @Override
    public WordsScore computeResult(ResultComputingContext&lt;? extends TextLabEquipment&gt; context) {
        
        //fetching the preliminary results
        final LettersFrequencies lettersFrequencies = context.preliminaryResult(LettersCounting.getInstance());
        final WordsFrequencies wordsFrequencies = context.preliminaryResult(WordsFrequenciesCalculating.getInstance());

        //return the result
        return new WordsScore() {

            @Override
            public double score(String word) {
                
                //compute hideous formula
                return (Math.log(lettersFrequencies.numberOfOccurencesForLetter(word.charAt(0))
                        /lettersFrequencies.totalNumberOfLettersOccurences()) + 1)
                        * wordsFrequencies.numberOfOccurencesInText(word);
            }
        };
    }
    
}	    
	  </pre><p>
	</p><p>
	  And now, you're going to <span class="emphasis"><em>decorate</em></span> that protocol with another protocol that does the "plus 1, squared" thing :
	  </p><pre class="programlisting">
/**
 *
 * A scoring protocol that adds one and squares the result of another.
 */
public class PlusOneSquaredWordsScoringProtocal implements Protocol&lt;WordsScore, TextLabEquipment&gt;{
    
    //the decorated protocol, to which the computing is forwarded
    private final Protocol&lt;WordsScore, TextLabEquipment&gt; delegate;
    
    @Override

	  All of that is great, but we don't want <code class="classname">Protocol</code>s, we want <code class="classname">Analyses</code>, right? How do I make the one into the other? Well, there's a special <code class="classname">Analysis</code> subclass for that, called <code class="classname">AnalysisWithProtocol</code>. Its as simple as this :
	  </p><pre class="programlisting">
        Analysis&lt;WordsScore, TextLabEquipment&gt; myModularAnalysis = new AnalysisWithProtocol&lt;&gt;(
                new PlusOneSquaredWordsScoringProtocol(
                new FrequenciesWordsScoringProtocol()));

	  This example gave you an overview of the <span class="application">Laboratory Toolkit</span> for an algorithm that reads words in a text. As you can see, there is nothing in its API that limits it to that kind of application. The <span class="application">Laboratory Toolkit</span> enables you to adopt a certain programming <span class="emphasis"><em>style</em></span>, regardless of what you're actually programming.
