The Laboratory Toolkit is a small, generic, self-contained JavaSE7 toolkit that provides a flexible API for developing heuristic, experimental, complex algorithms with a flexible an easy-to-evolve design.

Although it is not tied to a particular field of applications, it seems to be especially well-suited for data-mining, machine-learning, AI, statistics, evolutionary computing... in fact, any domain in which developing experimental algorithms looks more like alchemy or cooking than science.

The sources are all in the src/ directory.

The javadoc may be found in the dist/javadoc/ directory.

A guide may be found in the laboratory-tookit-guide_html/ directory.

Have fun! :)
