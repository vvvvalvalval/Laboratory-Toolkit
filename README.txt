The Laboratory Toolkit is a small, generic, self-contained JavaSE7 toolkit that provides a flexible API for developing heuristic, experimental, complex algorithms with a flexible an easy-to-evolve design.

Although it is not tied to a particular field of applications, it seems to be especially well-suited for data-mining, machine-learning, AI, statistics, evolutionary computing... in fact, any domain in which developing experimental algorithms looks more like alchemy or cooking than pure science.

The laboratory-toolkit-all Maven module consists of 2 Maven modules : the Laboratory Toolkit class library itself (laboratory-toolkit-all/laboratory-toolkit), and a module containing code samples (laboratory-toolkit-all/laboratory-samples).

A guide may be found in the laboratory-tookit-guide_html/ directory, and directly dowloaded as the laboratory-tookit-guide_html.zip archive.

Have fun! :)
